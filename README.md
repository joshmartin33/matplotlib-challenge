# matplotlib-challenge

## Background

Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specialises in anti-cancer medications has begun screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

I have been tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for a technical report of the clinical study, including a top-level summary of the study results.

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured.
